<br>
Here you can find MATLAB code for reproducing the results of the following paper:
"Fractional Derivative in Sparse Super Resolution"
<br>
In addition to MATLAB codes, a few Python script is also provided for creating tables of the paper.

# The program

The core of the program is <a href="http://www.ifp.illinois.edu/~jyang29/"> Yang's </a> MATLAB code for his pioneering paper:<br>
J. Yang, J. Wright, T.S. Huang, and Y.Ma, "Image super-resolution via sparse
  representation", IEEE transactions on image processing, vol.19,
  no.11, pp.2861-2873, 2010

The main MATLAB file for running the program is: SparseSR_Zooming.m

SparseSR_Zooming.m is used for both Train and Test.
